# RazX Official
## RazX by Akash Chaudhary – Launched on 28 June 2025
I started **RazX** because I couldn't find the best, most reliable packages for Linux. So, I decided to build a platform that delivers exactly that – **top-tier packages curated for your Linux system.** RazX isn’t just a package hub, it’s a growing ecosystem.

We also proudly present **RazX OS**, a Linux distribution crafted to give you speed, stability, and the very best tools right out of the box.

### Welcome to the future of Linux – built by a user, for the users.
